# MSDK

Mass Spectrometry Development Kit (MSDK) is a Java library of algorithms for processing mass spectrometry data. The goals of the library are to provide a flexible data model with Java interfaces for mass-spectrometry related objects (including raw spectra, processed data sets, identification results etc.) and to integrate the existing algorithms that are currently scattered around various Java-based graphical tools.
